Please take a few minutes to reflect on your experience in CSE 111 and
think about the challenges, successes, and all that you've learned
along the way.


Now, please respond thoroughly (1 - 2 paragraphs for each question) to
the following questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

    I saw the power of functions when we wrote the program for using functions
to randomely choose words and make sentences.
    I saw function's power when calling a particular function many times and have it 
perform a task multiple times at different locations. 
    I also saw the power of functions when we wrote the program that drew the 
outside scene, calling a function multiple times and have it perform a task severally.



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

    Test functions are one thing a good programmer can
never do without. It is bad writing a program without having functions
to test it. The value of a test functions is as that of the program itself.



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

    Troubleshooting programs has been of great help and importance 
to me, because I have come to realize that it would be nearly impossible 
trying to figure out a problem in my program without troubleshooting. 
    I will improve on adding print statements as a medium to help figure 
out problems on my programs one at a time, rather than writing a lengthy program, run it, and then 
start figuring out multiple problems.
